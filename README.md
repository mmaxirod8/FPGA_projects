# 📟 This repository contains several projects I've completed on various FPGAs, including code, help files, and results.

Some abbreviations (like "C_V", "C_IV", "X_N_3", etc.) are for the following FPGAs:
 - C --> Altera Cyclone / V, IV (Board model)
 - X --> Xilinx / N --> Nexys (Board model) / N° [e.g: 3] (Version number of the board model)
 - X --> Xilinx / Z --> Zedboard (Board model) 

¡I hope you find it useful!
