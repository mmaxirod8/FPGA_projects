# This repository contains several projects I've completed on various FPGAs, including code, help files, and results.

Some abbreviations like "C_V", "C_IV" are for:
 - C --> Altera Cyclone / V, IV --> Board model
 - X --> Xilinx / N --> Nexys (Board model) / N° (Version number of the board model)

¡I hope you find it useful!
